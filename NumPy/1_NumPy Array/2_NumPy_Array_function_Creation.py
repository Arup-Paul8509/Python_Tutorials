    NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.

    We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.
'''
import numpy as np 
arr1=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])#array created with list
arr2=np.array((1,3,5,7,9))#array created with tuple
print(arr2)
print(type(arr2))#type() returns type of object passes to it
